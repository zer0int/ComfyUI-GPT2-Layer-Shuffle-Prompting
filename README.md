## ComfyUI Shuffle Node for GPT-2 & prompting. üôà
### Shuffle GPT-2's layers, have the AI prompt an image.‚Äç‚ÅâÔ∏èü§ñüí´ü§¨

- Simply put "ComfyUI-GPT2shuffle" into "ComfyUI/custom_nodes" -> "zer0int" node group.
- Or use the provided workflow.
- Allows shuffling of Layers (Attn, MLP, Full Layer) of a chose GPT-2 model -> Prompt.
- Uses the GPT-2 base (foundational) pre-trained model. Will continue / complete your sentence.
- Why? It's interesting: A glimpse at how the base model works internally.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Output is highly unpredictable and likely to be inappropriate / NSFW. Use responsibly.
- Can be used in conjunction with [my CLIP, T5 & Flux Shuffle nodes](https://github.com/zer0int/ComfyUI-CLIP-Flux-Layer-Shuffle).
